     <h2>Differences betwwen "Quality&Quantity"</h2>
     <p>
        Mostly recently in Nigeria,esp. in the street of lagos, statistically we can say 70% of designer wears are Quantity not Quality,we see alot of market sellers and people on the street of lagos rocking Gucci especially, but my point is why do we have to wear hotse designer? Are we trying to feel among or trying to live up to standard of someone else? the answer is a low class nigeria prefers to by a designer with the big labels and not the small labels that are not quantity but quality.<br>
        we have alot of quality designer that are affordable and not too expensive for the low class, for example we have the likes of Addidas, Asos, celio, nike and so on. As we go on we will mention alot of them and give you links and websites to get them.
